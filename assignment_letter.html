            <p>Dear Ms. Abhishek,</p>
            <p>A constellation consists of visible stars that form a perceived outline or pattern, usually representing
                an animal, a person or mythological creature, or an inanimate object.</p>
            <p>The origins of the first constellations date back to prehistoric times. Their purpose was to tell stories
                of their beliefs, experiences, creation, or mythology. The recognition of constellations has changed
                over time. They varied in size or shape, others became popular and then were forgotten, and some were
                limited to a single culture.</p>
            <p>In the 20th century, a committee of the International Astronomical Union took it upon itself to
                accurately delineate the 88 constellations. It included 48 ancient constellations enumerated by the
                Greek astronomer Ptolemy, plus 40 new constellations. Each constellation is a region of the sky, and
                together they cover the entire celestial sphere.</p>
            <p>These 88 constellations divide the entire night sky as seen from Earth. Star maps are made from the
                brightest stars, and the patterns they form give rise to the constellation names.</p>
            <p>The star charts represent the position of the stars as we see them from Earth; however, the stars in each
                constellation may not be close to each other, as some we perceive to be brighter because they are close
                to the Earth.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
